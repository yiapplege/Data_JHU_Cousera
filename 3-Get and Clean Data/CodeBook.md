# CodeBook
## Overview
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
## Dataset
- `features_info.txt`: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- `features.txt`: List of all features. There is 561 features in total. 
- `activity_labels.txt`: Links the class labels with their activity name.
- `train/X_train.txt`: Training set with 7352 observations and 563 variables.
- `train/y_train.txt`: Training labels for activity.
- `train/subject_train.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- `test/X_test.txt`: Test set with 2947 observations and 563 variables.
- `test/y_test.txt`: Test labels for activity.
- `test/subject_test.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
